# This is a sample design-oriented project

I tried to make this as similar as possible from **Figma** to **HTML**, and it turned out better.(Not as same as the design, but overall look just turn out well)

Still it have some nasty issues, I might reiterate the dev process to acheive the design planned.

### Issues:
1. Not at all responsiveðŸ˜¢ (Works as expected in only desktop)
2. some placement issues. Need to study more on layering things.

### Design planned:
